* **Open a physical store.** This is the most traditional way to sell baked goods, and it can be a great way to build relationships with your customers. However, it can also be expensive and time-consuming to open and maintain a physical store.
* **Sell at farmers markets.** Farmers markets are a great way to reach a local audience and sell your baked goods directly to consumers. They can also be a lot of fun, and you'll get to meet other local businesses.
* **Sell at local events.** There are always events happening in your community, such as festivals, fairs, and concerts. These can be great opportunities to sell your baked goods to a large crowd.
* **Partner with other businesses.** If you have a local coffee shop or restaurant, see if they would be interested in selling your baked goods. This can be a great way to reach a new audience and increase your sales.
* **Start a delivery service.** If you don't want to open a physical store, you can start a delivery service. This can be a great way to reach customers who live outside of your immediate area.
* **Sell online.** There are many online marketplaces where you can sell your baked goods. This can be a great way to reach a global audience.
* **Sell at your own bakery.** If you have the time and resources, you can open your own bakery. This can be a great way to have complete control over your business and your products.

No matter which route you choose, make sure to market your bakery effectively. Use social media, print ads, and word-of-mouth to let people know about your business. And most importantly, make sure your baked goods are delicious!
